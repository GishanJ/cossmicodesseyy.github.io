    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We employed NASA's extensive dataset on celestial bodies and supplemented it with real-life measurements to accurately model the planets within our astronomical virtual reality program.
        To enhance the fidelity of our simulation, we integrated precise gravitational measurements into the gravitational fields, ensuring that the virtual celestial objects closely mimic the real-world counterparts. This methodology forms the core of our research project, facilitating a more immersive and scientifically accurate virtual representation of our universe."</p>
